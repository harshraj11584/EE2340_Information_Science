Verified the asymptotic equipartition property using simulations.  
For binary alphabet X = {0,1}, with p(0) = 0.75, estimated the value of P(n)=1−P(Aε(n)) through simulations and plotted its value for increasing value of n.  
P(n) is the probability that a randomly drawn n-vector is not ε-typical.
